# Reinforcment Learning methods for portfolio optimization

You can see our overview of several papers and articles which discuss RL methods in portfolio optimization setup. 
We are trying to answer why RL is even applicable, formulation of states and actions and why it could be benefitical to use RL in that problem.
The next step is to reproduce experiments from these papers.

Be ready for updates of RL methods in this directory.
