# Portfolio optimization

## Introduction

Traditional approaches for portfolio trading are conservative and not as effective as they can be. They aim for interpretability and concentrate mostly on Markowitz framework. We want to bring some novelty into this. Our main goal is to find out how various ML approaches perform on the task of portfolio optimization and its trading. Of course, interpretability is still the most important part.

## Why is that important?

There is a convention in science and statistics of investitions that most investors donâ€™t bring too much to the table. In other words, their added value for trading strategies is small. They could be right about general trading rules and have some insights, but they use non-effective approaches in portfolio construction. We want to decrease the human factor in weights allocations metter, although it is very important to intelligently select trading factors (it is the place where the model interpretability mostly comes from). Our mutual approach should unite the meaningful human insights with ML optimizations approaches.

## What we have done so far
 
- We worked with long-short trading approach. You can find all the details which include method's intuition, factor analysis, algortihms and results in 'long_short' directory
- We wrote an overview of Reinforcment Learning methods that could be used in portfolio optimization. Check the 'RL' directory.
