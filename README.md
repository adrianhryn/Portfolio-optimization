# Portfolio-optimization

### What is the purpose of this repository?

We aim to build a traiding algorithm which will automatically construct and trade a portfolio based on stocks.
If you want to get acquainted with all details, check our poster.

### How to reproduce our work:

In our work, we used Quantopian API which you can not run outside of Quantopian environment.
So, in order to run our code you should sign up and log in here (https://www.quantopian.com/posts).
Then you can upload our notebook and run it from top to down.

If you want to see the algorithms performance and their statistics, you should:
1. Click 'New Algorithm'
2. Upload a .py python file
3. Choose the backtest period
4. Click 'Build Algorithm'
5. Click 'Run Full Backtest' 
6. Get the statistics

All the requirements to libraries versions are satisfied inside the Quantopian platform.
Each of the .py files on this repository is a distinct algorithm which you can easily run if you follow the six steps above.
